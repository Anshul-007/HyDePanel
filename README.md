# FabricPanel

A semi customizable bar written using [Fabric Widget System](https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric) thus the name.
Head over to https://its-darsh.github.io/fabric-wiki/introduction/installation-guide/ for getting started with dependencies.

Then clone the repo, and start with `python main.py`

This is still in early development and will include breaking changes
